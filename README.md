# San ValentÃ­n ðŸ’–

A simple, interactive, and fun web page to ask someone to be your Valentine.

## Description

This project is a single-page web application that presents a "Will you be my Valentine?" question with "Yes" and "No" buttons. The "No" button is playful and avoids being clicked, while the "Yes" button triggers a celebratory message. The page features a Valentine's Day theme with a color gradient, animations, and falling emojis.

## Setup

No special setup is required. Simply open the `home.html` file in a web browser to view the page.

## Usage

Click the "Yes" button to accept the Valentine's request or the "No" button to see a variety of playful responses.
