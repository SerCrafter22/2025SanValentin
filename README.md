# San ValentÃ­n ðŸ’–

A simple, interactive, and fun web page to ask someone to be your Valentine, now powered by Vite and packed with new features!

## Description

This project is a single-page web application that presents a "Will you be my Valentine?" question with "Yes" and "No" buttons. It has been refactored to use Vite for a modern development workflow and includes several new features to make it more interactive and engaging.

## Features

- **Interactive "No" Button:** The "No" button will try to escape the cursor, making it a fun game to try and click it.
- **Personalized Greeting:** You can personalize the question by adding a `name` parameter to the URL (e.g., `?name=Ana`).
- **Confetti Celebration:** A beautiful confetti animation appears when the "Yes" button is clicked.
- **Progressive Web App (PWA):** The application can be installed on your device and will work offline.
- **Social Sharing:** After saying "Yes", you can share the good news on social media.
-**Accessibility:** The application has been improved to be more accessible to users with disabilities.
